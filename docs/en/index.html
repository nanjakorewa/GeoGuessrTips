Narrow down state or regionSoil color varies from region to region.Bright red soil is southwest or south, blackish color is inland from Delhi to south, and silky white soil is north?（Image source：By ncert - http://nroer.in/gstudio/resources/images/show/35270/, CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikimedia Commons）
Black soil, also called regur soil, is also suitable for growing cotton.(from Wikipedia 『Major soil deposits of India』)。
Alluvium deposited by the Indus and Ganges rivers is located in the northern part. It is generally flat with scattered wetlands, composed mainly of unconsolidated mud, sand, and stone. (from 『沖積層』)。
Even if the soil is red, if there are steep mountains and forests all around, consider Nepal\u0026rsquo;s east and west, etc.
Different regions have different languages, which can be distinguished by the shape of the letters.(by usumdensetu )Urban centers such as Delhi can be further narrowed down to areas by sector or block name, but note that there are sectors with the same name in different locations.language-name writingEnglishJapanese RestaurantJapanese日本料理レストランSinhaleseජපන් අවන්හලAssameseজাপানীজ ৰেষ্টুৰেণ্টKannadaಜಪಾನೀಸ್ ರೆಸ್ಟೋರೆಂಟ್Gujaratiજાપાનીઝ રેસ્ટોરન્ટTamilஜப்பானிய உணவகம்Bengaliজাপানি রেস্তোরাHindiजापानी रेस्टोरेंटKhmerភោជនីយដ្ឋានជប៉ុនLaoຮ້ານອາຫານຍີ່ປຸ່ນThaiร้านอาหารญี่ปุ่นAhmadabad area.

Signs for Alfa Mart (convenience store), Mandiri Bank, and Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) can be found even in smaller towns.
Cigarettes are often sold on the street. If it says \u0026ldquo;18\u002b\u0026rdquo; without a picture of cigarettes, it is an advertisement for cigarettes; if it says \u0026ldquo;GGSP\u0026rdquo;, it is a goodwill about the cigarette manufacturer Gudang Garam Tbk PT.
Depending on the mosaic, the license plate may appear to be divided into three parts\u0026hellip;? In addition to white, yellow and red license plates also exist.

Narrow down state or regionIt could be used to identify the region, as the soil color varies slightly from region to region. However, it is unclear if it can actually be useful.Although soils vary from region to region, it is not known if the colors are different.(from 『「Soil Map information in Indonesia」by Markus Anda, 2023年4月25日に利用』).

If there is a building with a blue or dark blue logo and the sign \u0022Газпром\u0022, it is probably Russian.Pipes often run over walls, fences, etc.(by now_and_jenn )Gazprom is the world\u0026rsquo;s largest producer and supplier of natural gas and is a Russian state-owned company. Nord Stream is also a major shareholder in Gazprom.
Crosswalk signs have three lines painted on them, and there are signs with distances written on the side of the road. The distances written on the signs are often quite long.
Pipes are stretched along the fence.
Narrow down state or regionNeed to determine plant distribution and dominant tree species by regionJapanese butterbur・Petasites japonicus growing in Sakhalin.(by sound_of_silence_wl )Many trees with needle-like leaves around Magadan (not sure what kind of trees)(by niwaisound )Note that the actual distribution is not as simple as this figure, but has gradations.（Reference：『序章　国土空間からみた循環と共生の地域づくり』 環境省, Link, 2023-4-1）Balashov, I., et al. \u0022Vega-Les Information System. Actual Features and Future Evolution.\u0022 IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science. Vol. 507. No. 1. IOP Publishing, 2020.Density of larch (brown area in the figure below) varies from place to place
Birch is an important clue because it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see and understand.
Butterbur grows throughout Japan and in Sakhalin.
Spruce is abundant near and west of the northwestern mountains.
There is blackish fertile soil (chernozem) from Ukraine to southern Siberia, and grain production is flourishing.The road has sand on the side in the central north provinces of Russia. (by sound_of_silence_wl )Astrakhan soil. (by sound_of_silence_wl )Chernozem is distributed in the red area (image from the United Nations, public domain).
The soil around Astrakhan is red and sparsely vegetated, so it is not difficult to identify.
It seemed to be blackish, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it has any characteristics.

There is even a \u0022WM\u0022, the logo of Waste Management, a major garbage disposal company in the United States.If the reverse ▽ sign (Yield the Road) sign says YIELD, it is USA, if not, it is Canada.Blue post
There are many large companies based in the United States. Companies like Waste management, Electric Power, and Water Authority are also publicly traded and have signs and logos all over town.
Narrow down state or region① Maybe you can narrow down the state by whether the license plate is on the front or not and the color of the license plate[Materials](by rumilb ).Are most license plates in states with \u0022new\u0022 yellow?(by niwaisound )② Post office buildings often have the state and city name on the wall.③ Once you find the Interstate and State Highway signs, you can narrow down your location.States can often be identified by their state highway signs. In some states, the shape of the state is the shape of the sign.Interstate highways (signs in blue with red hats) with even-numbered roads extending east-west and odd-numbered roads extending north-south, with the northeast having larger numbers.The highway exits are numbered, such as \u0022Exit 1,\u0022 and can be seen by zooming in.First, remember the areas that do not require a license plate on the front of the car (yellow areas), then remember the color of the license plate（Image source：By Raccoonny - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons）.
Apparently the following rules do not apply to 100% of all.United States numbered highwaysNorth-south highways are oddly numbered, with higher numbers from east to west.East-west highways are even and numbered from north to south.Dwight David Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense HighwaysNorth-south highways are oddly numbered, with lower numbers from east to west.East-west highways are even, with lower numbers from north to south.American Highways 101: Visual Guide to U.S. Road Sign Designs \u0026amp; Numbering Systems
Agricultural DistributionData Source：U.S. Department of AgricultureCorn production flourishes along the corn belt(from 『Corn: Production Acreage by County(USDA)』). However, corn is widely produced throughout the U.S., so the mere fact that a cornfield was found would not be enough to determine that it is in the central part of the country.
Soybeans are also distributed similarly to corn(from 『Crop Production Maps(USDA)』).
Most of the rice fields are in certain areas of California and along the river to the coast in Arkansas(from 『Crop Production Maps(USDA)』). If it is in California, from the clues on the utility poles, it should be possible to determine that it is in California.
No sign of cotton, but white cotton may have fallen by the roadside.(from 『Crop Production Maps(USDA)』)？
Specific areas around Florida(from 『Crop Production Maps(USDA)』).
There is no overlap of areas with corn or soybeans.
