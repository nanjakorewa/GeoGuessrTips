There is the Kalahari Desert and a flat landscape all around. Most areas are sparsely populated with shrubs and grasses. Few trees grow on either side of the paved roads.
Road numbers with \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo;. Lesotho has similar road numbers, but unlike Lesotho, Botswana is quite flat. There are not many roads, so if there are signs and intersections, you might be able to score 5,000 points.

As Wikipedia states, there is no other form of transportation to be found on the island except for rickshaws ( St. Martin\u0027s Island). If there is only a concrete road with a rickshaw, even if the guard is not visible, there is an excellent possibility of this island.

Many rural areas in Cambodia have houses built on stilts. Cambodia has a tropical monsoon climate with high temperatures and humidity throughout the year. Stilts protect from the heat during the day and provide a resting space for cows and buffaloes at night. They are also said to protect against flooding from heavy rains during the rainy season ( 2021．April1 在仙台カンボジア王国名誉領事館 瓦版 NO.6).
Companies that are well-known in Cambodia are depicted on the parasols and billboards. Beeline for telecommunications, Coca-Cola for soft drinks, LEO, Kingdom, Angkor for beer, etc. Angkor\u0026rsquo;s logo also depicts Angkor Wat ( カンボジアのビール事情). In the suburbs, bottled drinks are often sold under parasols .
I ordered Angkor beer from Cambodia. It was so delicious.

Agricultural DistributionData Source：U.S. Department of AgricultureCorn production flourishes along the corn belt( Corn: Production Acreage by County(USDA)). However, corn is widely produced throughout the U.S., so the mere fact that a cornfield was found would not be enough to determine that it is in the central part of the country.
Soybeans are also distributed similarly to corn( Crop Production Maps(USDA)).
Most of the rice fields are in certain areas of California and along the river to the coast in Arkansas( Crop Production Maps(USDA)). If it is in California, from the clues on the utility poles, it should be possible to determine that it is in California.
No sign of cotton, but white cotton may have fallen by the roadside.( Crop Production Maps(USDA))？
