Many rural areas in Cambodia have houses built on stilts. Cambodia has a tropical monsoon climate with high temperatures and humidity throughout the year. Stilts protect from the heat during the day and provide a resting space for cows and buffaloes at night. They are also said to protect against flooding from heavy rains during the rainy season ( 2021．April1 在仙台カンボジア王国名誉領事館 瓦版 NO.6).

Narrow down state/regionAgriculture and vegetation vary by location:Oil palms and banana trees are common in the southern region.Data source: Ghana Country Summary - U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); some images have been edited.Area codes can sometimes help identify regions:030: Accra031: Sekondi-Takoradi032: Kumasi037: TamaleThe further south you go, the more palm trees and denser forests you will find.

While it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember area codes, they may not be visible outside urban areas. Mobile numbers are more common, so it may be better to focus on recognizing city names, regional vegetation, and overall atmosphere. If you happen to see a fax number, use it as a reference.
In my experience, if the ground is more exposed or if there are many shrubs, it is likely to be in the upper half with a savanna climate ( Appiah, Divine Odame, Balikisu Osman, and James Boafo. \u0027Land use and misuse; Human appropriation of land ecosystems services in Ghana.\u0027 International Journal of Ecosystem 4.1 (2014): 24-33.).

VegetationThe Canterbury Plains on the South Island have windbreak forests and are known for irrigated agriculture. The Bay of Plenty region on the North Island also has windbreak forests and is a major kiwi fruit production area. Giant reed plants are found along the coasts of the North Island, especially around Auckland. Centered around Christchurch, the terrain is generally flat, and there are many tall windbreak forests.

Windbreak forests can be seen to protect crops from ocean winds, though they are not as common as in the Canterbury Plains.

Its southernmost growth is along the coasts of Christchurch.

Craggy rocks and small mountains can be seen.Northernmost part: Suburbs have very little grass.The further north you go, the drier and less woody it becomes, with plateaus to the northeast of Abuja and around Jos ( 『Kurowska, Ewa E., Andrzej Czerniak, and Muhammad Lawal Garba. - Afforestation of transformed savanna and resulting land cover change: a case study of Zaria (Nigeria).』 Sustainability 14.3 (2022): 1160.).
Compared to the north, there are more trees, and seeing far into the distance is almost impossible.
Oil palms are abundantly distributed. Between the yellow-green area in the figure (Uyo to Onitsha), plantations can be seen in the suburbs.
In the Southern Guinea Zone (orange), the ground is covered with grass.
Elevation is high, and tree density is not high. Rocks and small mountains can be seen in the distance.
The Sudan Zone (gray area) has almost no grass.
Different regions have different agricultural practices.Oil palm is common in coastal areas.( U.S. Department of Agriculture(USDA))Oil palm is only found in the coastal area.

If the license plate is yellow, the coils on the utility poles are large, or there are holey poles, you may be thinking of Sri Lanka, and if your car has a greenish license plate number or a unique-shaped vehicle, you may be thinking of the Philippines.

Agricultural DistributionData Source：U.S. Department of AgricultureCorn production flourishes along the corn belt( Corn: Production Acreage by County(USDA)). However, corn is widely produced throughout the U.S., so the mere fact that a cornfield was found would not be enough to determine that it is in the central part of the country.
Soybeans are also distributed similarly to corn( Crop Production Maps(USDA)).
Most of the rice fields are in certain areas of California and along the river to the coast in Arkansas( Crop Production Maps(USDA)). If it is in California, from the clues on the utility poles, it should be possible to determine that it is in California.
