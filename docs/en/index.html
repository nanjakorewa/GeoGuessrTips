Agricultural DistributionData Source：U.S. Department of AgricultureCorn production flourishes along the corn belt( Corn: Production Acreage by County(USDA)). However, corn is widely produced throughout the U.S., so the mere fact that a cornfield was found would not be enough to determine that it is in the central part of the country.
Soybeans are also distributed similarly to corn( Crop Production Maps(USDA)).
Most of the rice fields are in certain areas of California and along the river to the coast in Arkansas( Crop Production Maps(USDA)). If it is in California, from the clues on the utility poles, it should be possible to determine that it is in California.
No sign of cotton, but white cotton may have fallen by the roadside.( Crop Production Maps(USDA))？
Specific areas around Florida( Crop Production Maps(USDA)).
There is no overlap of areas with corn or soybeans.
