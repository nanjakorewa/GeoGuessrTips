Narrow down state or region① Maybe you can narrow down the state by whether the license plate is on the front or not and the color of the license plate[Materials](by rumilb ).Are most license plates in states with \u0022new\u0022 yellow?(by niwaisound )② Post office buildings often have the state and city name on the wall.③ Once you find the Interstate and State Highway signs, you can narrow down your location.States can often be identified by their state highway signs. In some states, the shape of the state is the shape of the sign.Interstate highways (signs in blue with red hats) with even-numbered roads extending east-west and odd-numbered roads extending north-south, with the northeast having larger numbers.The highway exits are numbered, such as \u0022Exit 1,\u0022 and can be seen by zooming in.First, remember the areas that do not require a license plate on the front of the car (yellow areas), then remember the color of the license plate（Image source：By Raccoonny - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons）.
Apparently the following rules do not apply to 100% of all.United States numbered highwaysNorth-south highways are oddly numbered, with higher numbers from east to west.East-west highways are even and numbered from north to south.Dwight David Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense HighwaysNorth-south highways are oddly numbered, with lower numbers from east to west.East-west highways are even, with lower numbers from north to south.American Highways 101: Visual Guide to U.S. Road Sign Designs \u0026amp; Numbering Systems
Agricultural DistributionData Source：U.S. Department of AgricultureCorn production flourishes along the corn belt(from 『Corn: Production Acreage by County(USDA)』). However, corn is widely produced throughout the U.S., so the mere fact that a cornfield was found would not be enough to determine that it is in the central part of the country.
Soybeans are also distributed similarly to corn(from 『Crop Production Maps(USDA)』).
Most of the rice fields are in certain areas of California and along the river to the coast in Arkansas(from 『Crop Production Maps(USDA)』). If it is in California, from the clues on the utility poles, it should be possible to determine that it is in California.
No sign of cotton, but white cotton may have fallen by the roadside.(from 『Crop Production Maps(USDA)』)？
Specific areas around Florida(from 『Crop Production Maps(USDA)』).
There is no overlap of areas with corn or soybeans.
