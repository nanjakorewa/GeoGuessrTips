{{% notice tip %}}
The sign is written in Greek, so the answer is Greece. Mathematical symbols such as “Ελληνικά” originate from the {{% goto "../../rule/europe/greece/" "Greek" %}} language. Text on signs can pinpoint a country or at least narrow it down to a language region such as the Spanish-speaking world.
