Sometimes you can see the car that captured Google Street View. The equipment on that “Google Car” can reveal the country. A vehicle with a black tape wrap on the front-right corner, like this one, is characteristic of {{% goto "../../rule/africa/ghana/" "Ghana" %}}. Ghana, {{% goto "../../rule/n_america/guatemala/" "Guatemala" %}}, and {{% goto "../../rule/africa/reunion/" "Réunion" %}} have particularly recognizable cars. That said, any country might occasionally show a different car, so never assume a 100% identification from the vehicle alone.
