I started playing GeoGuessr in February 2023. On this page, I save screenshots of things that caught my attention or interesting locations during gameplay. If you notice any mistakes or have any comments, please let me know in the comments section or through the GitHub issue tracker.

The non-Japanese pages are for studying the language. I am creating them little by little with the help of translation tools and a vocabulary book. Therefore, the pace of updating is expected to be very slow.

When you give us tips through comments, etc., it would be greatly appreciated if you provided the source page in the words. I will record the information you give me along with the source.

Example: Hello {{% by "nanjakorewa" "twitch" %}}. Good evening {{% by "geotips" %}}. Goodbye {{% ref "https://www.weblio.jp/content/%E5%B7%A6%E6%A7%98%E3%81%AA%E3%82%89" "『Left like that』" %}}.

Regarding the "CC-BY-" notation for each image, please refer to "<a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>" for more information. "GFDL" refers to the "<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>." If you find any images without a source citation other than public domain images, please kindly report them here. The images from USDA.gov are used as public domain information with reference links based on "<a href="https://www.usda.gov/policies-and-links">Policies and Links</a>." While some pages may include company products or logos, it is considered nominative fair use, meaning the use is within the scope of referencing trademarked goods or establishments without implying sponsorship or endorsement. Please contact me through the inquiry or comments section if you notice any problematic use. We will make corrections as soon as possible.

The maps shown may not depict remote islands or detailed areas for display reasons. Also, the map may not depict places not visited by Street View. Therefore, the actual shape may differ.

Also, since this is primarily for my notes, I might also note information that has nothing to do with Geoguessr.
