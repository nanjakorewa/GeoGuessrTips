<h4 class="no-blur">Frequently asked questions</h4>

- Q. May I use the content of this website for education?
  - A. Of course.
- Q. Some pages do not reflect information added after 2024.
  - A. Most of the pages were written in 2023 while I was streaming. At that time even resources such as plonkit had not gathered tips for every country, and similar references in Japanese simply did not exist. I built this site to organise my own notes, so there are still places where information—such as 2025 Google Car updates—has not been refreshed yet.
- Q. Could you add Street View screenshots?
  - A. Google’s terms forbid extracting Street View imagery, so I only use public-domain assets and similar resources.

<h3 class="no-blur">Overview</h3>

I started playing GeoGuessr around February 2023.

This page works as a notebook of interesting spots that caught my eye during games—almost like saving screenshots. If you notice mistakes or have suggestions, please let me know via the comment section or GitHub issues. Including the original source in your message helps a lot, and I will credit it in the following format.

Example) こんにちは{{% by "nanjakorewa" "twitch" %}}こんばんは{{% by "geotips" %}}さようなら{{% ref "https://www.weblio.jp/content/%E5%B7%A6%E6%A7%98%E3%81%AA%E3%82%89" "『左様なら』" %}}

Everything about countries, regions, cities, and history is written purely for enjoying GeoGuessr, and I aim to stay politically neutral. The maps shown here use the in-game depiction of borders for convenience and may differ from real-world administrative or political boundaries.

Images sourced from USDA.gov are linked according to their <a href="https://www.usda.gov/policies-and-links">Policies and Links</a>. Most road signs on this site are public-domain illustrations. A handful of pages—such as <a href="https://geopinning.space/rule/europe/baltic-state/latvia/">Latvia</a>—include credited images.

If you spot any problematic usage, please reach out via the comment field or contact options above and I’ll address it promptly. Other quotations follow Article 32, paragraph 1 of Japan’s Copyright Act.

Displayed maps may omit remote islands or tiny regions for layout reasons, and Street View locations may differ from the shapes shown on the map. Please note that this is a personal memo, so I may occasionally jot down topics that are not strictly GeoGuessr-related.
